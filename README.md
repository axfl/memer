# memer
chrome extension to let you access a meme folder in as few strokes as possible

Steps to install:

* First, download build.zip from "Assets" here: https://github.com/axfl/memer/releases
* Unzip build.zip by using 7zip on Windows, or double click it on mac
* Go to chrome://extensions
* On the top right, enable Developer Mode
* On the top left, there should be a button that says "Load Unpacked"
* Clicking this button will ask you to look for the extension you downloaded & unzipped. It's probably in your Downloads folder, find it and select it.
* make sure you're in the SECOND build folder that opens up. You should be loading the build folder INSIDE the unzipped build.zip.
* In your extensions, you should see MEMER listed. This means you've succesfully installed the extension!
